Hello! 👋, Welcome to Day 4 of my 50 Days **JavaScript Problem-Solving Challenge 🚀.**

I'm Rakibul Rahman from RR-Dev.

## 🎯 Today Task:

Today's task is very simple, write a function that takes three number type input (parameters) and return which is max number.

We following some step's and solve this problem.

Following step's is below:

1. Create a function that name is `findMaxNumber(a, b, c)` with three parameters.
2. Inside the function use javascript built in Math.max() methods to find out the max number.
3. Return the max value from function.
4. Call the function inside the `console.log()` and see the output in terminal.

**Example:**

```javascript
function findMaxNumber(a, b, c) {
	// your code;
};

console.log(findMaxNumber(4, 5, 60));
```

📝 If you don't call the function inside the `console.log()`, you can't see the output.
