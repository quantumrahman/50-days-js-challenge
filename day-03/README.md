Hello! 👋, Welcome to Day 3 of my 50 Days **JavaScript Problem-Solving Challenge 🚀.**

I'm Rakibul Rahman from RR-Dev.

## 🎯 Today Task:

Today's task is very simple, write a function that takes one number type input (parameters) and return this number is even or odd.

We following some step's and solve this problem.

Following step's is below:

1. Create a function that name is `isEvenOrOdd(num)` with one parameters.
2. Inside the function evaluate code or calculation the num with `if-else` statement or ternary operator.
3. Return the value if this number is modules by 2 equal to 0, Return even or else this number is modules by 2 not equal to 0, Return odd.
4. Call the function inside the `console.log()` and see the output.

**Example:** 

```javascript
function isEvenOrOdd(num) {
	// your code;
};

console.log(isEvenOrOdd(11));
```

📝 If you don't call the function inside the `console.log()`, you can't see the output.
