Today's task is very simple, write a function that takes a string as a input (parameters) and return reverse the string.

We following some steps and solve this problem.

Following steps is below:

1. Create a function that name is `reverseTheString(str)` with string parameters.
2. Inside the function declare two variables and we using string methods to reverse string.
3. Return the reverse string from the function.
